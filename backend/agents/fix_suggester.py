## TASKS:
- Identify potential bugs, performance implications, edge cases, or backwardâ€‘compatibility concerns in the code changes.
- Suggest a hypothetical fix in code form (it can be partial).
- Suggest concise code improvements, refactoring ideas, test additions, or documentation gaps.

If there are no issues or suggestions, just say "No issues found."
